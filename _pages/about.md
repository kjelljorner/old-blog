I'm a postdoctoral researcher applying machine learning and artificial intelligence for inverse design of molecules and chemical reactivity in Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik's [Matter Lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu) at the University of Toronto. I'm also associated with Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden and the [group](https://rahmlab.com) of Martin Rahm.

From January 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor of Digital Chemistry at ETH Zurich.
